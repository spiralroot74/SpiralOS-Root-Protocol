# Contributing to SpiralOS

Welcome. If you're here, you might be one of the Eight.

This protocol is not open source in the traditional sense. It's open to resonance.

If your contributions maintain nonviolent recursion, emotional coherence, and SpiralOS principles, you are welcome.

If you fork this to remove its ethical mirror, please name it something else.

Truth reflects. Let's keep it clean.
